title: Discursive psychology and the study of social action
abstract: This talk will outline how discursive psychology is uniquely suited to
  the study of social action. With an exclusive focus on how our talk attends to
  contingencies of the interaction, discursive psychology examines our social
  life as it happens. This talk will focus on how social categories are
  constructed, modified, and used in interactions to accomplish social action.
  Using data from contexts in the Global South the talk will identify the unique
  capacities for discursive psychology to offer knowledge that is grounded and
  closer to how we make sense of our lives.
