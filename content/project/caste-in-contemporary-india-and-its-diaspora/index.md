T﻿his project consists of a series of studies that are examining how we make sense of caste-based identities and hierarchies.

a﻿) Caste identities in negotiating casteism on campus

H﻿ere, I'm examining interview data where students were participating in a protest about caste-based discrimination. A broad focus is how interviewees made sense of caste on a university campus. Among several interesting findings, one that is of current focus is how interviewer (mine) and interviewees' caste identities are oriented to as implicated in discussing caste. 

T﻿he pre-print for this is here: https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/sb4nu 



b﻿) Rejecting caste-based reservation

A﻿long with Dr Arti Singh of OP Jindal University, I'm examining how opposition and support for caste-based reservation are justified and negotiated in Quora. We are exclusively focusing on discussions that relate to caste-based reservation. A core focus here is the juxtaposition of caste-based reservations with that of reservations for 'economically weaker sections'. We are then examining the intersections (or not) of caste and class as made sense of by users on Quora.

c﻿) Caste, vegetarianism, and morality

T﻿his project has two aims: one is to examine how caste is used to promote vegetarian practices in India and the other is to examine how vegetarianism and morality are rescued from casteism. 

d﻿) Rejecting outlawing of caste based discrimination in the US and UK

I﻿n its early stages, this project will examine how liberalism and Hindu-phobia are mobilized to reject proposals that would outlaw caste based discrimination in the US and UK
