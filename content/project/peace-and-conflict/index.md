T﻿his is a continuation from my work on justification and legitimization of violence / military action in the context of Israel and Palestinian relations. 

S﻿ince my MSc dissertation I have examined how leaders and spokespersons for Israel, Hamas, and Palestine construct and orient to the actions of their respective military units in relation to continued violence, resistance, occupation, and peace. 

C﻿urrently, I'm examining how Israeli leaders explain their positions on proposing, rejecting, or accepting ceasefire during the 2014 Gaza War.
