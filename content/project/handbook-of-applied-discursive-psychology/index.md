Along with [Dr. Simon Goodman](https://www.dmu.ac.uk/about-dmu/academic-staff/health-and-life-sciences/simon-goodman/simon-goodman.aspx), I am developing a Handbook of Applied Discursive Psychology. This is an edited text that covers cutting-edge research on prejudice, migration and refuge-seeking, misogyny & sexism, homo and transphobia, political and social movements, conflict, and climate crisis that uses discursive psychology.
