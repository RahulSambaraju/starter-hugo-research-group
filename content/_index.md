        Namaste! I, Dr Rahul Sambaraju host this research space. We are at the forefront of studying social exclusion/inclusion through discursive approaches. We use discursive psychology, membership categorization analysis, and conversation analysis to examine how we make sense of and navigate socially oppressive situations. Here, you'll find content related to current projects, publications, research collaborators, and other work that we do, using the menu tabs.
