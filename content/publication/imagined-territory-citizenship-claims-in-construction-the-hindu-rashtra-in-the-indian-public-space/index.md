abstract: "How do constructions of social polity inform constructions of nation?
  In this paper, we examine constructions of citizenship in India to examine how
  this accomplishes exclusion of Muslims and informs the (re)constitution of the
  Indian nation as Hindu Rashtra. While much research in social psychology has
  examined nations, in terms of social categories or territory, and their
  consequences for belonging or citizenship, what has not been fully taken-up is
  treating nations as ‘in the forming’. In this paper, we foreground nations as
  ‘in the forming’ to examine how citizenship policies, which construct various
  versions of the national polity, inform constructions of nations. We do so
  through a discursive and rhetorical examination of debates on citizenship at
  two momentous occasions for India: the drafting of India’s constitution
  (1946-50) and the Citizen Amendment Act 2019. Analysis shows that
  constructions of Indian citizenship were treated as informing distinct forms
  of territorializing India – as secular or Hindu Rashtra. The latter
  alternative is an imagined territory of Hindu Rasthra where those who are
  Hindus and other non-Muslims have privileged citizenship and claims over
  Indian territory over Muslim others. We then argue that constructions of
  citizenship can contribute to exclusion of other through offering alternative
  versions of nations themselves."
