abstract: "This paper analyzes descriptions of Ukrainian refugees in the
  aftermath of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Findings of previous research on
  news media descriptions of refugees point to problematic descriptions of
  refugees that downgrade their deservingness of refuge and treat refugee status
  as an inherent feature of fleeing individuals instead of as contingent on
  external circumstances. However, there is a widespread perception that
  Ukrainian refugees are being reported on in a more positive light. We
  therefore examine how news media describe these refugees. Our corpus includes
  English media news coverage from February 25, 2022, to March 25, 2022, the
  initial period of the invasion. A discursive psychological analysis of news
  interactions where hosts elicit information from correspondents about current
  ongoings with Ukrainian refugees shows that Ukrainian refugees are constructed
  as vulnerable, and their actions are treated as reasonable given the
  situation. These descriptions construct Ukrainian refugees as those who are
  only contingently refugees and legitimate help-giving by other parties. Our
  findings, therefore, highlight distinct, previously unanalyzed ways that
  refugees are constructed: contingent refugees. We discuss implications of our
  findings for understanding refugee inclusion and exclusion."
