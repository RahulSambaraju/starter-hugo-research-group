abstract: "Membership Categorization Analysis (MCA) has the potential to
  highlight the dynamic ways that people make race relevant to everyday life.
  However, existing MCA research conducts ana-lyses that are disconnected from
  the broader sociopolitical contexts within which race categories are developed
  and used. This article proposes an extension MCA that foregrounds ways that
  racial category use mobilizes racial inferences and is consequential for the
  constitution of knowledge about race and racism. Scholars conducting an MCA of
  race categories should (a) engage with social science research on race and
  racism (b) meet unique adequacy requirements for research. We apply these
  extensions to three key tenets of MCA: knowledge, the membership
  categorization device, and morality. We then pre-sent two illustrative
  analyses: from Asian Americans discussing business in the United States and
  from Indians discussing anti- Black racism in India. We close by discussing
  the implications of our framework for MCA and qualitative psychological
  research."
