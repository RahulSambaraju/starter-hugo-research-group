‘My mother did not have civil rights under the law’: race categories, past oppression, and negotiating positions on Critical Race Theory


Dr Rahul Sambaraju

Abstract


What is the relevance of historic oppression of racial groups for contemporary rights and entitlements? In this paper, I examine how racial group membership is constructed and oriented to as implying historical oppression and its relevance for contemporary interracial relations in the form of supporting or opposing Critical Race Theory (CRT) teaching in the US public school system. I examine debates and discussions on CRT televised in the American news media using discursive psychological approaches. Findings show that race categories are used to, first, negotiate rights and entitlements to discuss and support or oppose CRT in schools. Second, race categories are used to justify opposition to CRT. In both case, race categories are used to implicate historical racial oppression and its current salience. Race categories are treated to implicate normative claims to knowledge, experience, and entitlements proceeding from historical racial oppression in the US. These findings are discussed in relation to work in discursive psychology on race and racism and CRT itself.
Keywords: Critical race theory, race categories, racial oppression, membership categorization analysis, discursive psychology.
